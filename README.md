Herdr control-plane plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness):
19 `herdr_*` tools, a Web dashboard, and a Herdr session preset with a dedicated workspace.

> **Fork notice** — this repository is a fork of
> [NAMEWTA/dsh-plugin-herdr](https://github.com/NAMEWTA/dsh-plugin-herdr)
> (npm `@namewta/dsh-plugin-herdr` 0.0.3), adapted for **native Windows** DSH hosts:
> named-pipe transport, `tasklist`-based process probing, a Windows environment-variable
> allowlist, PowerShell/CMD installer guidance, and platform-neutral tool/skill text.
> See [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for the full Windows transport notes and
> upstream changes. MIT-licensed; upstream copyright retained.

## Requirements and supported downloads

Plugin **0.0.3** targets Node **24+** and DSH **0.2.0-rc.2**, **0.2.1-alpha.1**,
**0.2.1-alpha.2**, or **0.2.1-rc.3**. DSH's plugin installer also requires **pnpm on PATH**. Run the
plugin and Herdr on the same host — Linux, macOS, or native Windows x64/arm64
(Herdr 0.9.0 / protocol 22 baseline). Native Windows is supported through Herdr's
named-pipe control socket; WSL is still supported when both sides run inside the
same distribution.

As checked on **2026-10-11**, npm `latest`/`next` resolve to **0.2.0-rc.2**, while
`alpha` resolves to **0.2.1-alpha.2**. Thus `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web` does not
necessarily run the newest GitHub prerelease. See [compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md).

```sh
npm install --global pnpm@10.28.2
# Current default-download release, pinned for reproducibility
npm install --global @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2
# Or explicitly opt in to the latest alpha instead:
# npm install --global @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.1-alpha.2
dsh --version
pnpm --version
```

## Install the prebuilt plugin

Download `namewta-dsh-plugin-herdr-0.0.3.tgz` and `SHA256SUMS` from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NAMEWTA/dsh-plugin-herdr/releases). A release
is created only after main's full CI, real Herdr tests and DSH Web installation
matrix pass. The same package is also available in a successful `ci` run's
`herdr-plugin-package` artifact. **Publishing to npm is separate:** this workflow
does not publish there, and the registry's `latest` tag may still name an older
plugin release. Use the versioned tarball for this compatibility update.

```sh
# Run in the directory containing the downloaded package and checksum file
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS  # macOS: shasum -a 256 --check SHA256SUMS
dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/namewta-dsh-plugin-herdr-0.0.3.tgz
dsh plugin --profile web list
dsh web
```

Restart an already running Web profile after installing or replacing the package.
The same prebuilt tarball can be selected in DSH's plugin installation UI.
Open the **Herdr** sidebar entry to view the dashboard. Select **Herdr mode** for
a conversation's dedicated workspace. Herdr itself must be installed and running;
the panel can start its binary from `PATH` when available.

Do not install an unbuilt Git checkout directly: it contains no `lib/` artifacts.
A GitHub source archive is not the prebuilt plugin tarball.

## Herdr installation and environment settings

Open **Herdr → Installation & settings**, or **Settings → Built-in plugins → Herdr environment**.
The dashboard opens installation guidance automatically when the executable is missing;
the session server banner also exposes the same panel.

**Check environment / test connection** inspects the DSH Host, not the browser OS:
platform/architecture, Herdr executable/version, npm/pnpm availability, the configured
socket and terminal capability. CLI installation and server connectivity are independent.
Checks do not install software, start terminal sessions or edit configuration.

Herdr does not document an official npm installer. The panel shows the official
Linux/macOS installer (and Homebrew on macOS); npm commands are for pnpm and the pinned
DSH release only. On native Windows the panel instead shows the official PowerShell
installer with a `cmd.exe` fallback, plus the same npm and PATH steps. Copy commands to
a terminal on the Host, recheck, then explicitly start the server when needed.

Active connection settings are read-only: `terminalSession.binPath` / `HERDR_BIN_PATH`,
`socketPath` / `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, and `session` / `HERDR_SESSION`. Change the plugin
configuration or launch environment and restart DSH to edit them. Checks, server start
and terminals share executable discovery, including `~/.local/bin`; invalid explicit
paths never fall back silently. The official installer may select a newer Herdr than
our 0.9.0/protocol 22 baseline. The panel warns rather than claiming full compatibility.
It never automatically installs, stops, upgrades or replaces running software.

## Troubleshooting after installation

Installing this plugin does not install the Herdr executable or start its server. The
new management screen is included in **0.0.3**, not the earlier 0.0.2 package. Check the
installed plugin version; a package-name installation can resolve to an older npm release.
Install the explicitly verified tarball into the same profile, then restart that profile.

Use **Herdr → Installation & settings** or **Settings → Built-in plugins → Herdr environment**:

- **Executable not found:** follow the commands for the displayed Host system. An invalid
  explicit binary override remains visible in the settings; fix it rather than installing
  another binary that the override would hide. A browser on Windows can be connected to a
  Linux Host, so do not use the browser OS to choose installation commands.
- **Installed but disconnected:** inspect the displayed socket and session. Click Start only
  for the intended server; the plugin does not stop or replace an existing server.
- **Check/start failed:** the localized error includes a bounded technical cause when the
  Host provides one. After correcting paths or permissions, recheck. Do not clear your
  profile, credentials or existing workspaces as a troubleshooting step.

If the error persists, share the exact message, the Host OS, DSH/plugin/Herdr versions and
which action failed. Do not share API keys, authentication URLs or an entire environment dump.

## Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NAMEWTA/dsh-plugin-herdr.git
cd dsh-plugin-herdr
npm install --global pnpm@10.28.2
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm quality
pnpm pack  # prepack automatically builds Host + Typert + Web
pnpm check:package ./namewta-dsh-plugin-herdr-0.0.3.tgz
dsh plugin --profile web add ./namewta-dsh-plugin-herdr-0.0.3.tgz
```

## Upgrade and uninstall

Install the new tarball into the same `web` profile and restart it. A failed
compatibility check should be resolved by matching a supported DSH release,
not by forcing peer installation or copying another version's `node_modules`.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove @namewta/dsh-plugin-herdr
```

Restart the profile to unload the tools, panel and runtime-registered preset.
Only older manually copied presets may leave files in `.agent-presets/herdr/`;
the current plugin does not install a preset directory there.

## Development

This fork ships **built artifacts only** (`lib/` is the compiled output); the upstream
build pipeline (`src/`, `scripts/`, `test/`, `tsdown`/`tsc` configs) is not vendored.
`pnpm run check` is the runnable smoke test here — it syntax-checks every shipped
module. To build from source, use the upstream repository
[NAMEWTA/dsh-plugin-herdr](https://github.com/NAMEWTA/dsh-plugin-herdr).

The Windows adaptation is documented in [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) and was
verified against Herdr 0.9.3 / protocol 22 on real Windows and WSL-adjacent setups.
